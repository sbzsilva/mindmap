## How to View These Mindmaps

These mindmaps are created using Mermaid syntax and can be viewed in several ways:

### Option 1: GitHub Viewer (Recommended)
GitHub natively supports Mermaid files. Simply click on any `.md` file in the repository to view the rendered mindmap.

### Option 2: Local Viewing
1. Install a Mermaid-compatible Markdown viewer like:
   - [VS Code with Mermaid extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.vscode-mermaid-preview)
   - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced)
2. Open the `.md` file in your editor

### Option 3: Online Converters
Use online Mermaid renderers like:
- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)
- [Markdown to Mermaid Converter](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
